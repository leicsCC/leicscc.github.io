 Instructions for setting up a form so that others around the council can test it out.
 
 For testing purposes make sure the process and form are in the forms category 'Ext Test ICT'. Publish the process when ready. This category is set up for testing so that the public won't see the form but internal users will.
 
 Each person testing the form will need to be authenticated in the Firmstep permissions area with the right access. If they’ve not already done so:
 
 1. Ask the user to go to https://forms.leicestershire.gov.uk > click Login > click Office Login. Then log out and let us/you know when they’ve done this.
 2.	In Firmstep permissions, find the user > Edit > tick Office Login > in Groups add them to LCC Internal
 3.	User: Go to https://forms.leicestershire.gov.uk > click Login > click Office Login > then they can either go to https://forms.leicestershire.gov.uk/MyServices or you can give them a direct link to the test form

Things you need to do with the form in Self Admin:
 -	If you want to move the form out of ‘Other Ungrouped forms’: Go to App Management > Services > start typing the form name in the input box for Forms then add it. Click update at the top when done.
 -	Turn off Service Registration (requires people to sign up for My Account): Go to Navigation > Service Registration > tick the Blacklist box > Save
 -	Service Rating App – displays the star rating page after form submission. Navigation > Service Rating App > tick Blacklist if not wanted > Save
